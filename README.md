## Why should we use dart for flutter?

The Dart language usually outperforms all other development frameworks in terms of device performance. The Google-backed Flutter framework is an open-source development toolkit. It enables developers to post queries and gives them the authority to access various documents through open developer forums. The most common features are:-.

1. AOT and JIT compilation for fast reload and fast released code.
2. A good garbage collector to clean up after creating and destroying many objects.
3. Single threaded to avoid locks and therefore jank.
4. An arm compiler to avoid having another engine running the code on the device (aka React Native)
